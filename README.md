# IRIS-Flower-Classification
## Problem Statement
Multi-class Classification is the task of classifying a set of given objects/images into multiple predetermined categories. It is a common problem in computer vision and machine learning.
In this project you will build a multi-class classifier by applying conventional image processing
technique and machine learning. The classifier will classify a set of IRIS flower images into four
categories - 'crocus' 'daisy' 'pansy' 'sunflower'.
The original flower images and a set of mask images are provided for each image.
